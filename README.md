# Sliding-Window
This repository contains problems related to sliding window technique and its variants. It includes my approach and code implementation in java. The goal is to share a well structured documentation on sliding window while solving DSA and CP.  
The basic idea behind sliding window is to transform two nested loops into a single loop.  
The problem will be basically of array or arraylist or string data structure.  
It will ask to find 
 - subranges in that array
 - longest
 - shortest
 - target

It's concept is mainly based on the ideas like longest sequence or shortest sequence of something array or string that satisfies a given condition.
