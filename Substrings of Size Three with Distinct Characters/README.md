# [Substrings of Size Three with Distinct Characters](https://github.com/surya8980/Sliding-Window/blob/main/Substrings%20of%20Size%20Three%20with%20Distinct%20Characters/Substrings%20of%20Size%20Three%20with%20Distinct%20Characters.java)
# Problem Statement
A string is good if there are no repeated characters.  
Given a string s​​​​​, return the number of good substrings of length three in s​​​​​​.  
Note that if there are multiple occurrences of the same substring, every occurrence should be counted.  
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.  
Example 1:  

Input: s = "xyzzaz"  
Output: 1  
Explanation: There are 4 substrings of size 3: "xyz", "yzz", "zza", and "zaz".  
The only good substring of length 3 is "xyz".  
Example 2:  

Input: s = "aababcabc"  
Output: 4  
Explanation: There are 7 substrings of size 3: "aab", "aba", "bab", "abc", "bca", "cab", and "abc".  
The good substrings are "abc", "bca", "cab", and "abc".
